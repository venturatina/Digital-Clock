# Digital-Clock
The program is to display a digital clock that displays the current time in military and standard time.
The code was tio demonstrate industry standard to ensure clarity, consistency, and efficency.
I believe my use of functions and classes as well as having the least amount of code in main() were the parts of this assigment i did well in.
I could enhance my code my making the clock actually functional. 
I have a code that displays a functiona' digital clock(not included in this folder)
I also have this code that displays the last possible time and can be manipulated by the user with a menu
I tried and tried to get the fuctional clock added to my code but I kept getting error C4996: 'ctime': This function or variable may be unsafe
I was told to add header file #define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS I did add and still got the error
The skills I learned doing this project was the use of functions how to declare them earlier in the project and call them in other function and main() function
I did my best to organize the code in a way that makes sense and provided comment through out the code
